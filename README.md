Splitter
========

A small program to seperate out # comments (quizzes and problems) from the answer code.

Just save your progress as you go all in one text file. Make sure to denote each separate question+answer by
adding a line with just ! at the beginning.

When you're finished, the program will separate out and format all the questions and your answer key for you.
