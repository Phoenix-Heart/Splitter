Splitter
========

A small program to seperate out # comments (quizzes and problems) from the answer code.
Download the JAR executable code to run.

1. Save your progress as you go all in one text file. Make sure to denote each separate question+answer by
adding a line with just ! at the beginning.

2. Download the executable JAR from this repo and run it, selecting the location of the file you just created.

3. The program will separate out and format all the questions and your answer key for you.

4. Now you are ready to share your questions or answers with everyone!
