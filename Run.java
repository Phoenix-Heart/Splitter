/* Simple code to extract some quiz questions and answers.
 * Comments added liberally to aid readers who are new to Java or to programming
 * 
 * To use this program:
 * Copy and paste your questions and solutions into a text file and save. Put ! on its own line to separate each question.
 * Run program and navigate to your file and select it. Program will automatically run and generate two new files: 
 * A list of questions and an answer key.
 * 
 * 
 * Imports
 * IO imports file input/output for reading and writing.
 * Scanner is used to read command line if file selector option fails.
 * awt and swing handle file opening GUI elements
